One of the most remarkable aspects of this production is how it updates the setting and costumes to reflect a contemporary context. The film begins with a news report of the death of King Hamlet and the coronation of Claudius, which sets the tone for a political thriller. The characters wear modern clothes and use modern weapons, such as guns and explosives. The film also incorporates elements of surveillance and media, such as CCTV cameras and screens that show images of the characters and their actions.
 
Another notable feature of this production is how it explores the psychological complexity and ambiguity of Hamlet's character. Cumberbatch delivers a masterful performance that captures the range and depth of Hamlet's emotions, from his grief and despair to his wit and humor, from his madness and rage to his tenderness and compassion. Cumberbatch also adds some original touches to his interpretation, such as playing with a toy soldier or wearing a David Bowie T-shirt. He makes Hamlet a relatable and sympathetic figure, who is both a hero and a victim of his circumstances.
 
The film also highlights the themes and motifs that make Hamlet such a timeless and universal story. The film explores the questions of life and death, revenge and justice, loyalty and betrayal, appearance and reality, love and hate, sanity and madness, that are at the heart of Shakespeare's play. The film also emphasizes the role of fate and chance in shaping the events and outcomes of the story. The film shows how Hamlet's actions have unintended consequences that affect not only himself but also those around him, leading to a tragic and bloody finale.
