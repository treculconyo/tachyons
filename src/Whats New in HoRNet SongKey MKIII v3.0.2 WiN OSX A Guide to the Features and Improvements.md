## How to Use HoRNet SongKey MKIII v3.0.2
 
Using HoRNet SongKey MKIII v3.0.2 is very easy and intuitive. The plugin has a simple and resizable vector GUI that shows you all the information you need at a glance.
 
The main elements of the GUI are:
 
- The **Input Meter**, which shows you the level of the incoming audio signal.
- The **Tempo Display**, which shows you the detected tempo of the song in beats per minute (BPM).
- The **Key Display**, which shows you the detected key of the song in standard notation (e.g., C major) or in Camelot notation (e.g., 8B). You can switch between these modes by clicking on the display.
- The **Confidence Display**, which shows you how confident the plugin is about the detected key on a scale from 0% to 100%. The higher the confidence, the more accurate the detection.
- The **Chord Display**, which shows you the detected chord of the song in standard notation (e.g., Cmaj7) or in Roman numeral notation (e.g., I7). You can switch between these modes by clicking on the display.
- The **Chromagram**, which shows you a graphical representation of the intensity of each note playing in the song over time. The chromagram is divided into 12 columns, each representing one of the 12 notes in an octave (from C to B). The higher the column, the louder the note.
- The **Key Chromagram**, which shows you a graphical representation of how well each note fits into the detected key over time. The key chromagram is divided into 12 columns, each representing one of the 12 notes in an octave (from C to B). The color of each column indicates how well the note matches with the key: green means perfect match, yellow means acceptable match, red means poor match.
