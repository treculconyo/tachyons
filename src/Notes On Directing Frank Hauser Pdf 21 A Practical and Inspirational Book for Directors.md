# Notes on Directing: A Book Review
 
Notes on Directing is a book by Frank Hauser and Russell Reich that offers 130 lessons in leadership from the director's chair. The book is based on Hauser's 50 years of experience as a theatre director in England and his collaboration with Reich, a writer and director from New York. The book is not a typical how-to guide, but rather a collection of insights, tips, anecdotes, and quotes that cover various aspects of directing, such as casting, rehearsing, staging, communicating, collaborating, and creating.
 
The book is divided into four parts: The Director and the Script, The Director and the Actor, The Director and the Rehearsal, and The Director and the Production. Each part contains several short chapters that address a specific topic or challenge that directors face. For example, some of the chapters are titled "Don't Say It; Do It", "Don't Give Results; Give Actions", "Don't Be Afraid to Be Obvious", "Don't Be Afraid to Be Wrong", and "Don't Be Afraid to Be Silent". The chapters are concise and clear, often illustrated by examples from Hauser's own work or from other famous directors such as Peter Brook, Harold Pinter, Mike Nichols, and John Gielgud.

The book is intended for anyone who is interested in directing or working in theatre or film, whether as a student, a teacher, an actor, a writer, or an audience member. The book is not only informative but also inspiring and entertaining. It reveals the art and craft of directing as a creative and collaborative process that requires vision, skill, courage, and humility. The book also shows the respect and admiration that Hauser and Reich have for their profession and their colleagues. As they write in the introduction: "We hope this book will help you discover what directing can be: an exhilarating adventure of discovery; a joyous celebration of human possibility; a noble service to art and society."

One of the strengths of Notes on Directing is that it does not impose a single method or style of directing, but rather encourages directors to find their own voice and vision. The book acknowledges that directing is a complex and subjective art that depends on many factors, such as the script, the actors, the audience, the venue, and the budget. The book also recognizes that directing is a dynamic and evolving process that requires constant learning and adaptation. As Hauser and Reich write: "Directing is not a formula; it's a way of thinking."
 
Another strength of Notes on Directing is that it does not only focus on the technical aspects of directing, but also on the human and ethical aspects. The book emphasizes the importance of building trust, respect, and communication among all the participants in a production, from the playwright to the stage manager. The book also advises directors to be aware of their own limitations, biases, and emotions, and to seek feedback and criticism from others. The book also urges directors to be responsible and respectful towards their art form and their audience. As Hauser and Reich write: "Directing is not a game; it's a responsibility."
 
Notes on Directing is a book that can be read and reread many times, as each reading can reveal new insights and perspectives. The book is also a book that can be applied and tested in practice, as each lesson can inspire new experiments and challenges. The book is not only a valuable resource for directors, but also a source of inspiration and enjoyment for anyone who loves theatre or film.
