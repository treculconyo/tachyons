Zanjeer 3 is not just a remake of the 1973 classic, but also a tribute to the legendary actor Amitabh Bachchan, who played the iconic role of Vijay in the original film. Ram Charan has tried to emulate the intensity and charisma of Bachchan, and has succeeded to a large extent. He delivers a powerful performance as the angry young cop who does not bow down to anyone. He also showcases his skills in martial arts and horse riding in some of the action scenes.
  
Priyanka Chopra adds glamour and charm to the film as Mala, a NRI girl who witnesses a murder and becomes Vijay's love interest. She shares a good chemistry with Ram Charan and also provides some comic relief in the otherwise serious film. Sanjay Dutt and Srihari are impressive as Sher Khan, the reformed car dealer who becomes Vijay's loyal friend. They bring a sense of warmth and camaraderie to the film.
  
The film also has some negative points, such as the weak script, the lack of memorable dialogues and songs, and the over-the-top villainy of Prakash Raj and Mahie Gill. The film also suffers from some editing glitches and continuity errors. The film could have been more engaging and gripping if it had focused more on the plot and less on the glamour.
  
Zanjeer 3 was released on September 6, 2013 in India and overseas. The film faced competition from another big release, Shuddh Desi Romance, starring Sushant Singh Rajput and Parineeti Chopra. The film also faced protests from some Muslim groups who objected to the use of Moharram procession in the climax. The film was banned in Pakistan due to its anti-Islamic content.
