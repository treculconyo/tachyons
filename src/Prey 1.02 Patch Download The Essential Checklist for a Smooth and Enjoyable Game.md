# How to Download and Install Prey 1.02 Patch
 
Prey is a sci-fi first-person shooter game that was released in 2006 by Human Head Studios and 2K Games. The game features a Native American protagonist who is abducted by an alien spaceship and must fight his way out using various weapons and abilities. Prey received positive reviews from critics and players for its innovative gameplay mechanics, such as portals, gravity manipulation, and spirit walking.
 
If you own Prey on Steam, you may have noticed that there is a new update available for the game. This update is called Prey 1.02 (previously v0.5 beta update) and it fixes some issues with save games becoming corrupted[^1^]. It also includes compatibility files for the Mac port of Prey, meaning PC users can play against Mac users and vice versa[^2^]. However, this update does not include any bug fixes or new content for the game.
