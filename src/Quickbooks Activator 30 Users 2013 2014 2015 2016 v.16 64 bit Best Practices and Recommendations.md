# How to Activate Windows 8 Enterprise Build 9200 with KMS Server
 
Windows 8 Enterprise is one of the editions of Windows 8 that offers advanced features for business users. However, activating Windows 8 Enterprise can be a challenge if you don't have a valid product key or a volume license agreement. In this article, we will show you how to activate Windows 8 Enterprise Build 9200 with a public KMS server.
 
KMS stands for Key Management Service, which is a technology that allows organizations to activate multiple computers with a single product key. A KMS server can be hosted by Microsoft or by a third-party provider. A KMS client can connect to a KMS server and request activation for a specific product. The activation is valid for 180 days and can be renewed periodically.

But activating Windows 8 Enterprise with a KMS server is not the only benefit of this edition. Windows 8 Enterprise also offers some exclusive features that can enhance the productivity and security of your business. Here are some of them:

- **Windows to Go**: This feature allows you to create a portable version of Windows 8 Enterprise on a USB drive. You can then boot from this drive on any compatible PC and access your files, settings, and applications. This is useful for traveling workers, contractors, or disaster recovery scenarios.
- **BranchCache**: This feature enables you to cache files and web content from central servers to local servers or PCs. This can reduce network traffic and improve performance for remote offices or workers.
- **AppLocker**: This feature allows you to control which applications can run on your PCs. You can create rules based on file attributes, publisher signatures, or hash values. This can help you prevent malware infections, enforce software licensing policies, or restrict access to sensitive data.
- **DirectAccess**: This feature allows you to connect your remote PCs to your corporate network without using a VPN. You can use IPv6 and IPsec protocols to encrypt and authenticate the traffic. This can simplify the management and security of your mobile workforce.
- **Enhanced VDI support**: This feature allows you to use touch-based Windows devices to access virtual desktops hosted on Windows Server 2012. You can also use RemoteFX technology to deliver rich graphics and media experiences over low-bandwidth connections.
- **Side-loading**: This feature allows you to install internal applications developed using the Modern UI interface without using the Windows Store. You can use Group Policy or PowerShell scripts to deploy these apps to your PCs. This can help you customize and optimize your business workflows.

As you can see, Windows 8 Enterprise has a lot to offer for businesses that are looking for a modern and secure operating system. However, it also has some challenges that you need to be aware of before upgrading.
