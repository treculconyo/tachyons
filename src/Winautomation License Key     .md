But before you can enjoy the full benefits of WinAutomation, you need to register your license key. A license key is a unique code that identifies your WinAutomation product and grants you access to its features. Without a valid license key, you will not be able to use WinAutomation beyond the trial period.
 
So how do you register your WinAutomation license key? It depends on whether your machine is connected to the internet or not. Here are the steps for both scenarios:
 
## Machine is connected to the internet
 
If your machine is connected to the internet, registering your WinAutomation license key is very easy. You can enter a license key in your WinAutomation console by clicking on the "Enter License Key" button (in case you are trialing WinAutomation) or the "Change License Key" (if you want to enter a different license key). Enter your license key to the relative field and press the "OK" button as shown below[^3^].

WinAutomation will then verify your license key with the WinAutomation licensing server and activate your product. You will see a confirmation message that your license key has been successfully registered.
 
## Machine is not connected to the internet
 
If your machine is not connected to the internet, registering your WinAutomation license key is a bit more complicated. You will need to use another device that has internet access and visit the [WinAutomation user support site](https://support.winautomation.com/). You will need to create an account and activate it from the email that will be sent to you. Then, you will need to login with the email under which the purchase was made and find your license key on the dashboard.
 
Once you have your license key, you will need to generate an offline activation file. To do this, you will need to copy your machine ID from your WinAutomation console. The machine ID is a unique identifier of your machine that is used for licensing purposes. You can find it by clicking on the "Enter License Key" button (in case you are trialing WinAutomation) or the "Change License Key" (if you want to enter a different license key). Then, click on the "Offline Activation" button as shown below.

You will see a window with your machine ID and a field where you can paste an offline activation file. Copy your machine ID and go back to the WinAutomation user support site. On the dashboard, click on the "Generate Offline Activation File" link next to your license key. Paste your machine ID and click on the "Generate" button. You will see a code that is your offline activation file. Copy this code and go back to your WinAutomation console.

## Troubleshooting
 
Sometimes, when you open the WinAutomation console, you may be prompted to register your license key again. This may happen for a number of reasons, such as:
 
- The `C:\ProgramData\Softomotive\WinAutomation\GlobalSettings.dat` file is missing. This file contains the license key encrypted. If the file is missing, it will be auto generated when WinAutomation server boots[^2^].
- The machine ID changed. The machine ID is generated using the UUID of the machine and the serial number of the OS. If these values change due to updates or changes in your 8cf37b1e13
