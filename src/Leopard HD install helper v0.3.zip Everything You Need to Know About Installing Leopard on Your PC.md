- You need to have Windows installed on your PC, which might not be the case for some users who want to run only Leopard.
- You need to create two partitions on your hard drive: one for dumping the Leopard ISO image (Install Partition) and one for installing Leopard (Destination Partition). This might reduce your available disk space or require you to resize or delete existing partitions.
- You need to use a partition tool to create and format the partitions, which might be complicated or risky for some users who are not familiar with partitioning.
- You need to change the ID and the active status of the Install Partition using a partition tool, which might be confusing or tricky for some users who are not experienced with partitioning.
- You might encounter some issues with booting from the Install Partition or installing Leopard on the Destination Partition, which might require you to troubleshoot or seek help online.
